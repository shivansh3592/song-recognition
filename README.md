# song-recognition

A Website to identify which English song is playing. https://secret-beyond-86077.herokuapp.com/ 
Uses Mido22's [recorder.js](https://github.com/Mido22/MediaRecorder-sample) to record audio and then identify song using [AudD api](https://audd.io/)

## Running website 
Due to nature of the site, Its not possible to run site locally. You need to host code on sites like heroku to run it.
